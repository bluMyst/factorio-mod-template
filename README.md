Some quick notes for experienced programmers that I had to figure out the hard way. If you're not an experienced programmer, this might actually just confuse you more. It's hard to say.

[This post](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=4858) and [this wiki article](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Lua_objects) are by far the best resources for documentation on Factorio modding. If that doesn't work, you can try the [official docs](http://lua-api.factorio.com/), but they're pretty bad.

`print()` doesn't work. You need to get a player entity from the game (`game.local_player` is probably good) and call `.print()` on that. Also you have to manually `tostring()` everything before printing, but that's Lua's fault, not the devs'.

To run Lua code in the game, type tilde/grave (the \`/~ key) and use the /c command. For example, `<tilde>/c a = 1337`. Unfortunately, this doesn't work like a REPL. To get it to print something out for you, you need to use `<tilde>/c game.local_player.print(tostring(foo))`. And even then, it won't print out tables for you. Such is the joy of Lua.

If you have basically any kind of Factorio-related object, you can get a help string through `foo.help()`. You still need to print that string out, though.

So for the most part, mods really just call `data:add()` and nothing else. `data`, I think, is a gigantic table of every single thing in the game. Recipes, items, entities, etc. You can `:add()` to that table to create your own items and entities, but you don't get much control over them if you do that. You can make a turret that runs on water or a solar panel that uses power instead of producing it, but you can't do much more than that. You can't, for example, make a PID controller or a cake item that heals health. You can only slightly modify existing items and entities.

Factorio mods have a few 'magic lua files', as I call them. These get run by the game at various times. I still have yet to figure most of them out, but data.lua seems to be run at the very start of the game. It's (mostly?) for lua files that just do `data:add()` stuff. In data.lua, you probably just want a whole bunch of `require` lines and nothing else. Factorio objects like `game` and `script` aren't defined yet when data.lua gets run. There's also `control.lua`, which you do **not** `require` in data.lua. If you do, you'll get an error because `game` (or whatever you first referenced) isn't defined.

Also I've seen a few mods where there are just random lua files hangin' out with no data.lua or control.lua to run them. So I guess those get run too, at some point. No idea. Maybe control.lua is run the same way, and it's just a convention thing to call it control.lua.
